            <p>
              A career in coding is the right choice for me because I enjoy problem solving, creativity and critical thinking. Having recently completed my degree in Integrated Working with Children and Families, including a number of placements and paid employment, I decided to change career path. As a result, I have researched alternative careers and courses, decided to learn Python and quickly gained an interest in coding. I am a self-motivated, high achiever and work well in both team and individual settings. With additional coding skills I believe that I can apply myself to a career in the digital sector. 
I have a strong academic record, my highest achievement being a 1st class BA honours degree.  I also have 10 GCSEs at grade C or above (including 3 Bs, 3 As and an A*) and two Cache diplomas, both at grade A.  In learning and working environments I am attentive and enthusiastic. I am keen to excel at coding and utilise my other strengths to bring more than just technical competence into a future role.  Dedication and commitment to learning are key to my success.  I complete all coursework on time and to a high standard and achieve excellent results even in challenging circumstances; the best example being a 1st class honours degree during the Covid-19 pandemic!
Many of the skills I have learned to date will be beneficial to my future role in the technology sector.  These include excellent organisational, leadership and social skills as well as strong mathematical, problem-solving skills. I am familiar and competent with the latest technology; often helping others with technological issues.  I am also keen to tap into my creative side, having a flair for art.  
At this stage I am not completely sure about which specific role I want to pursue after the bootcamp but I do know that I want a career in coding or certainly in the digital/technology industry.  Having researched a number of technical roles, web development appears to be a good fit; given the potential to apply artistic skills, more so than other tech roles I have considered.  My expectation is that as I learn to code I will conduct further research and seek support to help me with this decision.
I am keen to apply my diverse skillset into coding and pursue a career in the tech industry.  I am a committed, conscientious and a determined learner.  I complete work to a very high standard and achieve excellent results.  I also receive excellent feedback from teachers, tutors and lecturers as well as employers.  Given these attributes, I know that I can achieve an excellent outcome from the bootcamp and embark on a successful career in technology.
