      to the user what is likely to be on the page. Meta data is specified here including charset 'UTF-8'; which
      refers to the 256 different characters that are available to use within this code (including the English and 
      international alaphabets). The viewport mete data used in this code states that the browser will usually render 
      the width of the webpage in acordance with the screen size. The style.css has been referanced here so that the 
      external style sheet is linked with this html and will effect the styling of the page. The reset.css file has 
      been added so that there is a default style of the page if there are any issues with browers and unavailable 
      styles or if any changes or misates are made to style.css. The reset.css style sheet has been referenced before 
      the style.css so that the page will replace this with the newest version of the CSS, as the reset is just a default. -->

          <p>
            A career in coding is the right choice for me because I enjoy problem solving, creativity and critical thinking. Having recently completed my degree in Integrated Working with Children and Families, including a number of placements and paid employment, I decided to change career path. As a result, I have researched alternative careers and courses, decided to learn Python and quickly gained an interest in coding. I am a self-motivated, high achiever and work well in both team and individual settings. With additional coding skills I believe that I can apply myself to a career in the digital sector. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong academic record, my highest achievement being a 1st class BA honours degree.  I also have 10 GCSEs at grade C or above (including 3 Bs, 3 As and an A*) and two Cache diplomas, both at grade A.  In learning and working environments I am attentive and enthusiastic. I am keen to excel at coding and utilise my other strengths to bring more than just technical competence into a future role.  Dedication and commitment to learning are key to my success.  I complete all coursework on time and to a high standard and achieve excellent results even in challenging circumstances; the best example being a 1st class honours degree during the Covid-19 pandemic!
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the skills I have learned to date will be beneficial to my future role in the technology sector.  These include excellent organisational, leadership and social skills as well as strong mathematical, problem-solving skills. I am familiar and competent with the latest technology; often helping others with technological issues.  I am also keen to tap into my creative side, having a flair for art.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I am keen to apply my diverse skillset into coding and pursue a career in the tech industry.  I am a committed, conscientious and a determined learner.  I complete work to a very high standard and achieve excellent results.  I also receive excellent feedback from teachers, tutors and lecturers as well as employers.  Given these attributes, I know that I can achieve an excellent outcome from the bootcamp and embark on a successful career in technology.

              This project is a code refactor to support a marketing agency website. The website contains information about Search Engine Optimisation, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. It contains header, navigation, aside, section, figure, article and footer elements; which are styled in CSS. Within this code refactor I updated the title, fixed a link, replaced repetitive div tags with semantic elements, added alternative text descriptions to images and updated the CSS acordingly. As a result, this made the website more modern and suitible for HTML 5, more accessible for disabled users, improved funtionality and supported search engine optimisation.

            <p>I created this website before starting the bootcamp course. I wanted to make a guide that supported my learning of HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript. The guide includes definitions of Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and some useful tips on how to use them. The website is very simple to use, if the user right clicks on the website and then selects inspect this will open the DevTools console. When the DevTools console is open the user can see that Javascript has been used to suggest a topic to study at random. During this project I learnt how to write code, save files and debug issues.</p>

    selector has been given to 'my first project' in order to use different styling in css. As the 
    'My first project: Code Refactor' and 'Prework Study Guide' websites have been completed and deployed links 
    have been referanced so that when the user clicks on the image (screenshot) they are directed to the page.
    As I have only completed two projects in total, place holder images and paragraphs have been added to update 
    the site in the future. Alternative text has been added to all images to support accessability for those using 
    screen readers, to support search engine optimisation and to inform the users what image should be available if
    it is unable to load.-->
