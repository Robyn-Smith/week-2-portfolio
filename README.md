## Description

This project involved using HTML and CSS code to creat a webpage for a portfolio. This website contains a descriptive title, header, navigation, main, aside, article, section and footer elements. Further features include: 
- a profile picture of the student, displayed in the aside.
- a bold heading featuring the students name, displayed in the header.
- images of the students pervious work with titles, descriptions and working links to the deployed websites, displayed in the article and section elements.
- working navigation links that direct the readers to the corresponding sections.
- a list of the students contact, details displayed in the footer.
- different sized images, pleasing background colours/image.
- a responsive webpage layout that changes according to screen size or viewport.
- images containing alternative text.
- an 'About Me' section that describes the student, displayed in the aside.

It is important that the content of the portfolio includes lots of helpful information to the users, and potential employers, reading the webpage. Important information has been added including an 'About me' section summarising the student personally, pictures of the student, examples of their work and contact details. This is so that potential employers have all information they need to make an informed decision and contact the student if they wish to employ. It is therefore important that the webpage is interactive, functional and visably pleasing to improve the student's chances of employment. The colour blue has connotations of calm, wisdom and reliability, all of which are important skills in any job, this is why a blue colour scheme has been chosen to symbolise these traits in the student. Brighter blue and white fonts, boxes, text decorations/weights (such as underlines and bold attributes), emojis, borders, and box shadows have been used to enphasise important aspects on the page and to make it asethetically pleasing. Contrasting browsers and differing available styles have also been considered within the CSS by including attributes such as font-family which lists a number of fonts that are similar, to use if the other fonts are not supported by the users browser. Similarly, the reset.css file has been added as a default css style sheet to use if there is any problem with the style.css external sheet. 

Another note worthy aspect of this website is the use of alternative text descriptions on all images. This supports accessiablity for those using screen readers, supports search engine optimisation and therefore traffic to the page; and is also a great fall back description to all users if the image is unable to load. The webpage is also responsive to differing screen sizes. A media query, and flex display attributes were added to various aspects of the css in order to achieve this, for example when the screen is small the navigation links are stacked rather than in-line with each other; as their flex direction is set to columns. This allows users on different devices to view all content on the webpage. Functionality is shown through the use of naviagtion links and links to deployed work via selecting images. This makes the page much easier to use and read and allows easy access to the students work and capabilities.
